# OrangeHRM-PT  

OrangeHRM Performance Testing Project  
🚀 Overview:  
This repository contains a fully-automated performance testing project for the OrangeHRM demo website, designed and executed using Apache JMeter. Every key transaction and   user behavior has been simulated, tested, and validated to ensure accurate performance benchmarking and analysis.  

✅ What’s Included
✔️ End-to-end Load Testing, Stress Testing, Spike Testing, and Endurance Testing  
✔️ Clean, modular test plan built with JMeter    
✔️ Scenario optimization to reflect real-world usage  
✔️ HTML Reports for test visualization and analysis  
✔️ Verified performance metrics: Response Time, Throughput, Error %, CPU/Memory usage  
✔️ Integration with GitHub for version control and collaboration  

📊 Performance Metrics Monitored  
Average & Percentile Response Times  
Hits Per Second / Requests Per Second  
Error Rate  
Server CPU / Memory Utilization  
Latency Under Load  
Concurrent Users vs. Stability  
🔍 Each metric was carefully measured under various test loads, and the system behavior was evaluated to detect bottlenecks or scalability issues.  

🎯 Test Scenarios:  
Admin, PIM, leave, time, recruitment, performance, maintenance and Buzz pages are all tested to ensure full functionality of OrangeHRM website   
  
Each scenario is structured with appropriate think times, ramp-up durations, thread groups, and realistic test data to mimic actual user behavior.
